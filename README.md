# Securibench Micro.js

A [Securibench Micro](https://github.com/too4words/securibench-micro/tree/master) inspired program analysis benchmark for server-side JavaScript. This uses [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) as the server-side framework.

All test cases can be found under `test-cases` and each test case endpoint matches the directory structure, e.g., `test-cases/aliasing/1.js` can be pinged at `localhost:3000/aliasing/1`.

To start:

```
npm install
npm start
```
